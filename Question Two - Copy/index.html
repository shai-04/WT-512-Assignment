        <p>
            Chances are that you've already entered a few scores. Here's an explanation as 
            to what the buttons below do.
        </p>

        <p class = "explanation">
            <span>Display Scores: </span>Does exactly what you think it does, it displays the 
            scores you've entered.
        </p>

        <p class = "explanation">
            <span>Display Average Score: </span>Calculates the average of the scores you've entered and displays it.
        </p>

        <p class = "explanation">
            <span>Reset Scores: </span>Deletes all the scores you've entered and allows you to start the 
            process all over again.
        </p>
