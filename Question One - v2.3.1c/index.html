            <span>1</span> Notice the <span>3x3 grid</span> above? That's where the game takes place. It's 
            basically made up of <span>3 rows</span> and <span>columns</span>.
        </p>

        <p class = "explanation">
            <span>2</span> Once you've wrapped your head around that, choose whether you play 
            as <span>X</span> and your friend as <span>O</span> or vice versa.
        </p>

        <p class = "explanation">
            <span>3</span> With that out of the way, you and your friend must now take turns placing 
            your respective symbols on the board (by <span>clicking</span> each square).
        </p>

        <p class = "explanation">
            <span>4</span> First player to get <span>3 of their symbols</span> next to each other (either 
            <span>horizontally</span>, <span>vertically</span> or <span>diagonally</span>) wins the match.
        </p>

        <p class = "explanation">
            <span>5</span> Becareful though, if all <span>9 squares</span> are <span>occupied</span> and none of 
            the players have managed to place <span>3 symbols</span> next to each other, the match is called a draw 
            and you'll have to start again!
        </p>

        <p class = "explanation">
            <span>6</span> If you don't want <span>music</span> or <span>sfx</span> to be played, click the <span>toggle music</span> or 
            <span>toggle sfx</span> buttons to toggle the music and sfx respectively. Alternatively, press <span>ctrl + m</span> 
            to mute all sounds within the browser. Should this not work, try looking for a <span>speaker icon</span> near the 
            <span>tab manager</span> and hover over it for more instructions. However, if your browser doesn't support audio, 
            there will be text indicating this below.
